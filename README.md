# Assignment 4 - Getting and Cleaning Data

The goal of this assignment is to create a tidy data set for the Data Science Couse, Getting and Cleaning Data. The data set used can be found here: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones] (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

There are five steps in this assignment and involves the creation of `run_analysis.R` that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Create a final, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#Files
`Codebook.md` outlines all variables, transformations and data used.

`run_analysis.R` code file runs the analysis outlined above.

`average_set.txt` is the final cleaned data set from step 5.
